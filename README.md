# 💖 Will You Go Out With Me? – Interactive Robot Animation

This is a cute and interactive HTML/CSS-only project where a lovable robot asks:  
**"Will you go out with me?"** 💌

Built with creative CSS and animated flair, this little project is perfect for a playful confession or just to charm someone with your front-end skills!

## 🧠 Features

✨ **Fully HTML + CSS Only** — No JavaScript required  
🎯 **Mouse Tracking Head Movement** — The robot's head subtly follows your cursor  
😭 **Crying Eyes Animation** — Hover over **"No..."** and watch the robot tear up  
😍 **Loving Eyes Animation** — Hover over **"YES!!!"** and see the love sparkle  
🎮 **Retro Game Style Font** — Using [Game Bubble](https://fonts.cdnfonts.com/css/game-bubble) font for that arcade charm  
🎨 **Pastel Aesthetic** — Soft pinks, blues, and purples for a dreamy vibe


## 🛠 How It Works

- The **robot face** is built with layered divs, gradients, and blur effects.
- There are multiple **"eye" states** hidden by default:
  - Normal white ovals 👀
  - Crying "T T" eyes 😢
  - Heart-shaped SVG eyes 💖
- On hover:
  - The `No...` button activates `.cry` eyes using the `:hover` selector.
  - The `YES!!!` button activates `.love` SVG hearts.

And all of this magic is pulled off with just **HTML + CSS**!

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Hover around and enjoy the cuteness 🥺💗

## 💡 Inspiration

This was built as a creative, sweet way to make someone smile – perfect for a Valentine, confession, or just showing off what CSS can do without a single line of JavaScript!
